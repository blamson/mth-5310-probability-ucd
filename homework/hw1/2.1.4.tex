\subsection*{Exercise 1.4}

For events $A$ and $B$, find formulas for the probabilities of the following events in terms of the quantities $P(A)$, $P(B)$ and $P(A \cap B)$.

\subsubsection*{A}

\textbf{Either $A$ or $B$ or both}

This is just the union of the two events.

\[P(A \cup B)\]

\subsubsection*{B}

\textbf{Either $A$ or $B$ but not both}

We can use the same formula here but we need to be sure to remove the intersection of the two.

\[P(A \cup B) - P(A \cap B)\]
