What is the most rigorous mathematical definition for probability that you know or have learned?

Any of the definitions for probability (that I remember) are some variation of Kolmogorov's Axioms. Here's one from \textbf{Mathematical Statistics: An Introduction to Likelihood based Inference} by Richard J Rossi (2018). 

\noindent \fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
		\begin{definition}[Kolmogorov's Probability Function]
			Let $\Omega$ be the sample space associated with a chance experiment, and let $\beta$ be a $\sigma-$algebra of events of $\Omega$. A set function $P$ on $\beta$ satisfying the following three properties is called a probability function or a probability measure.

			1. $P(\Omega) = 1$
			
			2. $P(A) \geq 0$ for every event $A \in \beta$

			3. If $\left\{ A_i : i \in N  \right\} \subset \beta$ is a collection of disjoint events, then:

			\[P\left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i)\]

			The triple $(\Omega, \beta, P)$ is called a probability space.
			
		\end{definition}
