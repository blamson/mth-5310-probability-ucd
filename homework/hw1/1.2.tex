How would you describe the purpose of probability to a friend that has a limited math and stats background.

Big picture, probability is all about learning to understand random events. Randomness defines nearly every aspect of our lives, and probability gives us the tools we need to wrangle some understanding and insight into the chaos that surrounds us. With probability, events that would otherwise be incomprehensible can now be broken down and analyzed. I think a lot of people attribute probability to just dice rolls and gambling, but it's so much deeper than that. Probability can help you model the behavior of real world random events like a wildfire or hurricane; potentially saving peoples lives. The world is random, and probability is crucial to learn from the world on its own terms.
