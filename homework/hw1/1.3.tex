\subsection*{3}

Give examples of the following three sample spaces.

\subsubsection*{Discrete and of infinite dimension}

Number of times to use a slot machine before a jackpot.

You could get a jackpot in one go, however it could theoretically take infinitely many plays. 

\subsubsection*{Finite and continuous}

The precise (to some degree) mass of a 2kg bag of rice from a specific manufacturer. The bags will all be just about 2kg as advertised and they definitely can't have infinite mass, but there will be some variation to the exact mass of each bag. One bag may be 2.0001kg and another may be 2.005kg for example. 

\subsubsection*{Something of interest to you}

Proportions of neurodivergent employment across different corporate industries. It's a proportion, so it's between zero and 1. Finite and continuous. It's interesting to think about what industries most/least heavily employ individuals on the autism spectrum for instance. How does employment for bipolar individuals compare from healthcare to finance? Lots of interesting things to look into there I think.
