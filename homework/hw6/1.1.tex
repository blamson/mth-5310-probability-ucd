\noindent The notes provided by Francesco Corona from the Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza define the pdf of a mixture distribution as follows:

Let $p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n$ be positive mixing probabilities where $p_1 + p_2 + \cdots + p_n = 1$

Let $S = \cup_{i=1}^n S_i$ and consider the function

\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= p_1f_1(x) + p_2f_2(x) + \ldots + p_nf_n(x) \\
	&= \sum_{i=1}^n p_if_i(x), \; x \in S
\end{align*}

$f(x)$ is non-negative and it integrates to one over $(-\infty,\infty)$.

$f(x)$ is a PDF for sme RV $X$ of the continuous type.

\subsection*{1.}

Write the pdf for a mixture of two normal distributions. Define all notation.

\begin{align*}
	X_1 &\sim N(\mu_1, \sigma^2_1) & p_1 &= p & S_1 &= (-\infty, \infty) \\
	X_2 &\sim N(\mu_2, \sigma^2_2) & p_2 &= 1-p & S_2 &= (-\infty, \infty)
\end{align*}

Let $p$ represent the mixing probabilities. As we only have two of them, it allows easy setup. Our mixed distribution support $S = (-\infty, \infty)$ as well due to it being the union of our two given supports.

From here, we simply plug in our values.

\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= p_1f_{x_1}(x) + p_2f_{x_2}(x) \\
	&= p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_1} \cdot exp\left[ \frac{-(x-\mu_1)^2}{2\sigma^2_1} \right] + 
		(1 - p) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_2} \cdot exp\left[ \frac{-(x-\mu_2)^2}{2\sigma^2_2}\right]
\end{align*}
