\subsection*{2.}

Imagine you want to simulate the outcome for one person from a population where the outcome is from a mixture distribution of two normal pdfs. Explain which of the following is the correct strategy.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use a Bernoulli distribution (based on the mixing proportion) to randomly assign your simulated person to one of the two subpopulations, and then use that subpopulations normal pdf to simulate their outcome.
	\item Randomly simulate an outcome from each of the two normal pdfs, and then create the final simulated outcome equal to the weighted average of these two with the weights being the mixing proportions. That is, the final outcome equals the sum of each simulated outcome times the proportion of the population in that subgroup.
\end{enumerate}

Number 2 here is the correct answer as it is essentially, in plain english, the definition of the mixture distributions PDF that I have on the first page of this assignment. You do exactly what is said in 2. I'm not sure what else to say here, feels like I should have more to this answer but I find it very clear simply looking at the definition!
