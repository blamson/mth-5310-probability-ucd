\subsection*{2.31}

\textbf{Does a distribution exist for which $M_X(t) = \frac{t}{1-t}$, $|t| < 1$? If yes, find it. If not, prove it.}

To tackle this problem we want to run through some sanity checks for how we know moment generating functions should operate. If it passes these checks, we find find the distribution.

Firstly, we know that $M_X(t) = E[e^{tx}]$. Therefore, $M_X(0) = E[e^{0x}] = 1$. Does our given mgf align with that?

\noindent $M_X(0) = \frac{0}{1-0} = 0 \neq 1$.

Because it failed this basic check this mgf cannot have a distribution.
