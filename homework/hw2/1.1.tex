\subsection*{1.}

Give only a short answer: Which of the CDF, PDF, and/or the PMF is used to show random variables have the same probability distribution? Cite a theorem from the text to support your answer.

\noindent \textbf{Solution:}

The CDF is used for this, however I believe the PDF/PMF should be able to do this as well because of the definition of identically distributed RVs.

\begin{theorem}
	The following two statements are equivalent.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are identically distributed.
		\item $F_X(x) = F_Y(x)$ for every $x$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
