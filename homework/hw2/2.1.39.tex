\subsection*{1.39}

A pair of events A and B cannot simultaneously be mutually exclusive and independent. Prove that if $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, then:

\subsubsection*{A} If A and B are mutually exclusive they cannot be independent.

Let A, B be mutually exclusive. 

Because of this, $A \cap B = \emptyset$.

Therefore, $P(A \cap B) = 0$.

Because $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, $P(A) \cdot P(B) > 0$.

Because $P(A \cap B) = 0 < P(A) \cdot P(B)$, A and B are not independent.

\subsubsection*{B} If A and B are independent they cannot be mutually exclusive.

Let A, B be independent.

So $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$.

Because $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, $P(A \cap B) > 0$.

As $P(\emptyset) = 0 < P(A \cap B)$, A and B cannot be mutually exclusive.
